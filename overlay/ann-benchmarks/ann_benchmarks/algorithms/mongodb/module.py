"""Percona Search for MongoDB (mongot), driven by ann-benchmarks.

The other modules in this overlay talk to a server that owns its own index.
This one talks to two processes: `mongod` holds the documents, and a separate
Lucene process, `mongot`, holds the index and is fed from mongod's change
stream. Four things follow, and each is a place where a benchmark written for
the other engines would silently measure the wrong thing.

  Build is asynchronous. createSearchIndex returns in milliseconds and the
  index is unqueryable until mongot has finished its initial sync, so `fit`
  polls until the index reports READY and counts the wait. The index is created
  after the load, not before: created first, mongot queues an initial sync over
  an empty collection and the index stays PENDING while the writes stream past.
  `build_seconds` is therefore load plus wait, and the mode is a third kind --
  not incremental on INSERT like MHNSW and VIDX, and not a blocking bulk build
  like pgvector.

  Search width is a per-query argument. numCandidates goes inside the
  $vectorSearch stage rather than into a session variable, and it is clamped to
  at least k, because numCandidates below limit cannot return limit rows and
  the shared grid starts at ef_search 10.

  Vectors are BinData float32. As a BSON array of doubles the corpus would cost
  8 bytes a dimension in mongod, twice what the same vectors occupy in Lucene.

  There is no plan to inspect. $vectorSearch has no fallback to a collection
  scan the way a SQL optimiser does: without the index the aggregation errors.
  The check is kept anyway so that an erroring configuration and a genuinely
  slow one are told apart in the record rather than both appearing as low QPS.
