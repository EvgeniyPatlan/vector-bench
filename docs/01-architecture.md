# Architecture

## 1. System overview

`vector-bench` is a self-contained directory. It never writes to the three vendor
repositories — it reads them, clones from them into its own `sources/`, and does
all work under its own tree.

    subgraph host["Host — VECTOR_RESEARCH/"]
        direction TB
        subgraph ro["Read-only inputs (never modified)"]

```

The key structural point: **two independent measurement paths write into one
results directory.**

- The `*-bench` images run under ann-benchmarks and produce recall/QPS.
- The `*-runtime` images are driven directly by our ops harness and produce build
  cost, concurrency, filtered-search and churn numbers.

Both emit the same JSON-lines record schema, so the report generator does not
care which path produced a given metric.

## 2. Container build model

Each engine has one Dockerfile with two published targets.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph build["Stage: builder"]
        direction TB
        B1["distro + toolchain<br/>+ build deps"]
        B2["COPY source.tar<br/><i>git archive of pinned tag</i>"]
        B3["cmake · make -j · make install<br/>→ /opt/&lt;engine&gt;"]
        B1 --> B2 --> B3
    end

    subgraph rt["Target: &lt;engine&gt;-runtime"]
        direction TB
        R1["distro + runtime libs only<br/><i>no compiler, no source</i>"]
        R2["COPY --from=builder /opt/&lt;engine&gt;"]
        R3["entrypoint: init datadir + start server"]
        R1 --> R2 --> R3
    end

    subgraph bn["Target: &lt;engine&gt;-bench"]
        direction TB
        N1["FROM &lt;engine&gt;-runtime"]
        N2["+ python3, numpy, h5py<br/>+ DB client driver"]
        N3["+ ann-benchmarks run_algorithm.py"]
        N1 --> N2 --> N3
    end

    B3 ==>|artifact| R2
    R3 ==> N1

    rt -.->|"docker run — manual testing,<br/>see docs/03-running-manually.md"| USE1["you, by hand"]
    bn -.->|"driven by ann-benchmarks"| USE2["recall / QPS sweep"]
```

`SOURCE_MODE` build-arg selects where the source tarball comes from:
`local` (default — `git archive` out of `sources/`) or `upstream` (clone from
GitHub inside the builder, for publishing a recipe others can rebuild).

## 3. The web UI

A fourth container, and the only one that is not part of a measurement. It
serves the browser interface: a run index, the manifest as a page, an explorer
over the records, and buttons for the long commands.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    B["browser<br/><i>127.0.0.1:8080</i>"] --> W

    subgraph wc["vector-bench/webui container"]
        W["webui.server<br/><i>stdlib HTTP</i>"]
    end

    W -- "reads" --> RES["results/ · config/ · datasets/"]
    W -- "./run-benchmark.sh run, fetch, build …" --> ORCH["orchestrator<br/>on the host's Docker"]
    W -. "only with --allow-control" .-> SOCK["/var/run/docker.sock"]
    ORCH --> ENG["engine containers"]
```

Three properties that are not obvious from the picture:

* **The repo is bind-mounted at its own absolute host path**, not at a tidy
  `/app`. The orchestrator hands *host* paths to the Docker daemon when it
  launches engine containers, so a container-only path would be resolved by the
  daemon against the host filesystem, where it does not exist, and the engine
  would come up with an empty mount.
* **The container runs as the invoking user.** As root, git refuses the
  bind-mounted working copy as "dubious ownership" — which stops every run
  before it starts — and everything written under `state/` and
  `config/profiles/` lands root-owned on the host.
* **The Docker socket is mounted only with `--allow-control`.** Read-only mode
  needs nothing but the filesystem, so it is safe to leave running.

Nothing runs alongside a benchmark: a download or a compile during an ingest
measurement perturbs exactly what is being measured. See
[08-web-ui.md](08-web-ui.md).

### Where an engine is defined

One file per engine, `config/engines/<name>.yml`, and the orchestrator reads the
directory rather than a list. Besides the build recipe, server flags and SQL
dialect, each carries a `runtime:` block:

| Key | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `driver` | Which `harness/drivers/` class drives it. Several engines share one — `mariadb` and `mariadb123` are the same server at different tags |
| `ann_constructor` | The class name ann-benchmarks expects. Must be unique: it keys the result files |
| `port`, `data_mount`, `server_data_mount` | Where to connect and where its data lives inside the image |
| `credentials` | The bench account |
| `probe` | Readiness command, run until it succeeds |
| `chart`, `label`, `order` | How it is drawn and named, and where it sits in the ordering |

These were once six dictionaries keyed by engine name, spread across
`ann_pass`, `ops_pass`, `cli`, `charts` and `render`. Missing one did not fail
at load: it failed after a server had already started, or drew a recall chart
quietly missing a series.

Two consumers cannot read this file, and are given what they need instead:

* **`harness/`** runs in a container mounting `harness/` only, so the
  orchestrator passes `--driver`.
* **`report/`** mounts `report/` and `harness/` only, so each engine's colour
  and label are written into `run-manifest.json` and read back from there. An
  engine added later therefore draws and names itself correctly in a report
  without either package being edited.

Both constraints are enforced by tests, because both were violated in practice —
an orchestrator import inside `report/` once crashed generation at the end of a
twenty-hour run.

## 4. Vector-search internals, side by side

The original three engines solve the same problem with materially different
plumbing.
This is what the benchmark is actually measuring.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph mdb["MariaDB 11.8 — MHNSW"]
        direction TB
        M1["SQL layer<br/><code>ORDER BY vec_distance_cosine(v,q) LIMIT k</code>"]
        M2["Optimizer picks VECTOR INDEX"]
        M3["MHNSW graph cache<br/><i>per TABLE_SHARE</i><br/><code>mhnsw_max_cache_size</code>"]
        M4["Graph stored in a hidden<br/>companion table (#i# files)"]
        M5["Storage engine:<br/>InnoDB or MyISAM"]
        M1 --> M2 --> M3 --> M4 --> M5
    end

    subgraph ali["AliSQL 8.0.44-2 — VIDX"]
        direction TB
        A1["SQL layer<br/><code>ORDER BY VEC_DISTANCE(v,q) LIMIT k</code>"]
        A2["Optimizer by cost, or FORCE INDEX"]
        A3["Two caches:<br/><b>MHNSW Share</b> (TABLE_SHARE, read-only trx)<br/><b>MHNSW Trx</b> (per-session, RW trx)<br/><code>vidx_hnsw_cache_size</code>"]
        A4["Graph in an InnoDB<br/>auxiliary table, 1 row per node"]
        A5["Storage engine:<br/><b>InnoDB only</b><br/><i>requires READ-COMMITTED</i>"]
        A1 --> A2 --> A3 --> A4 --> A5
    end

    subgraph pg["PostgreSQL 17 — pgvector HNSW"]
        direction TB
        P1["SQL layer<br/><code>ORDER BY embedding &lt;=&gt; q LIMIT k</code>"]
        P2["Planner picks hnsw index scan"]
        P3["No dedicated graph cache —<br/>pages served from <code>shared_buffers</code>"]
        P4["Graph in a normal index relation<br/>(index AM pages)"]
        P5["Heap + index, standard buffer manager"]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4 --> P5
    end
```

Consequences that show up in the results:

- **Cache design drives concurrency behaviour.** MariaDB's single per-share cache
  and AliSQL's share+transaction split respond differently as client count rises.
  pgvector inherits PostgreSQL's buffer manager, which is mature but not
  vector-aware.
- **Graph-in-a-table (MariaDB, AliSQL) vs graph-in-an-index-AM (pgvector)**
  changes what "index size on disk" means and how build cost scales.
- **`ef_construction` is only tunable in pgvector**, so build-quality tradeoffs
  are not symmetric.

## 5. Benchmark data flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as run-benchmark.sh
    participant D as datasets/
    participant I as Docker image
    participant E as Engine (in container)
    participant R as results/&lt;run-id&gt;/

    U->>U: resolve profile + engines + datasets<br/>collect sysinfo, write run-manifest.json
    U->>D: fetch HDF5 dataset (train, test, ground-truth)
    U->>I: build if image digest missing

    rect rgb(240, 246, 255)
    note over U,R: Path A — recall / QPS (ann-benchmarks)
    U->>I: run.py --algorithm &lt;engine&gt; --dataset … --runs N

    loop each ef_search in grid
        I->>E: query all test vectors, k=10
        E-->>I: neighbour ids + per-query latency
    end
    I->>R: results/&lt;dataset&gt;/&lt;k&gt;/&lt;engine&gt;/*.hdf5
    end

    rect rgb(245, 255, 245)
    note over U,R: Path B — ops harness
    U->>E: docker run &lt;engine&gt;-runtime (cpuset + mem limit)
    U->>E: ingest, timed; build index, timed

    end

    U->>R: finalize manifest (durations, image digests)
    U->>U: report/generate.py
    U->>R: report.md · report.html · charts/*.svg
```

## 6. Results pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A1["ann-benchmarks<br/>HDF5 results"] --> N["normalize.py<br/><i>one record schema</i>"]
    A2["ops harness<br/>JSONL"] --> N
    A3["run-manifest.json<br/><i>env + versions</i>"] --> N
    N --> DF["records.parquet /<br/>records.jsonl"]
    DF --> C1["Pareto: recall@10 vs QPS<br/><i>per dataset</i>"]
    DF --> C2["Build cost:<br/>time · RAM · index bytes vs M"]
    DF --> C3["Concurrency:<br/>QPS + p99 vs clients"]
    DF --> C4["Filtered: recall/QPS<br/>vs selectivity"]
    DF --> C5["Churn: recall drift"]
    C1 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 --> MD["report.md"]
    C1 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 --> HTML["report.html<br/><i>self-contained</i>"]
```

A record is one row of:

```
run_id, engine, engine_version, dataset, metric_space, pass (normalized|tuned),
storage_engine, M, ef_construction, ef_search, k, clients, phase,
recall_at_k, qps, latency_p50_ms, latency_p95_ms, latency_p99_ms,
build_wall_s, build_cpu_s, peak_rss_bytes, index_bytes, ingest_rows_per_s,
selectivity, churn_fraction, timestamp
```

Unused fields are null. One flat schema keeps the report generator simple and
makes the raw data trivially queryable with any tool.
